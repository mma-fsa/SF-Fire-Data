# San Francisco Fire Data
** where should we build a new fire station?**

## Purpose

This tool uses geospatial statistics to estimate the current coverage areas of fire stations in San Francisco.  You can simulate building a new first station, and see the impact on the response times.  The response time impact is generated from real traffic data (although it is cached and not queried in real-time).

## Running

In this directory, start the HTTP server:

```python -m http.server 8080```

navigate to http://localhost:8080
